Initialization:

The program starts by importing the necessary libraries, including tkinter.
Functions for button clicks, clearing the display, and calculating results are defined.
Main Window Creation:

The main window of the calculator GUI is created using the tk.Tk() function. Attributes such as title, size, and background color are configured for the window.
Display Area Setup:

A StringVar() object named display_var is created to store the value displayed in the calculator's display area.
The Entry widget is used to create the display area, linked to display_var.
Button Creation:

Buttons for numbers, operators, and special functions (clear, calculate) are created using the Button widget.
Each button is assigned a label, font, color, and command function corresponding to its functionality.
Grid Layout Management:

Widgets (display and buttons) are arranged in a grid layout within the main window using the grid method.
Padding for the buttons is adjusted using the grid_configure method.
Event Loop:

The mainloop method is called on the main window to start the Tkinter event loop.
This loop continuously listens for user interactions and responds accordingly.
User Interactions:

When a button is clicked, its corresponding command function is executed.
For number buttons, the button_click function appends the value of the clicked button to the display area.
For the clear button, the clear_display function clears the display area.
For the calculate button, the calculate function evaluates the expression displayed in the calculator's display area and displays the result.
Error Handling:

If an error occurs during evaluation (e.g., division by zero), the calculate function displays "Error" on the calculator's display area.
User Feedback:

Throughout the process, the calculator provides visual feedback to the user, such as updating the display area with input and displaying error messages when necessary.
Termination:

The program continues running until the user closes the calculator window or exits the application.
